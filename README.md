# Hydrogen Reporter
A fast and lightweight SwiftUI console and view state reporter that can be used to see active logs and system statistics. Extremely useful for on the go debugging or when your apps need to be debugged over long periods of times that you can't be connected to a computer for!

## Features
- View and debug SwiftUI view state during app execution with no computer
- Debug custom types with a simple extension
- View logs as they get sent to the console
- View current device statistics such as Ram and CPU usage
- Add custom debug views to the reporter view
- Only active during Debug sessions so no need to worry about removing for production!

### Export Logs

## Getting Started
### Swift Package Manager
Add the following url to your Swift Packages through Xcode
```
https://github.com/ActuallyTaylor/HydrogenReporter
```

### Sample Code
#### Initialization
To get started first import `HydrogenReporter` and then add the `.hydrogenReporter()` view modifier to your main view. This will initalize the reporter and add the floating menu to your app.

```
import HydrogenReporter

struct SampleApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .hydrogenReporter()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Adding a SwiftUI view to the reporter
To add your custom view to the reporter menu you just need to add the `.debuggable(self, id: "ID")` modifier to any view. This will register it with the reporter and allow you to view it's debuggable properties!

This sample adds the following Sample View to the reporter with the tag of Main View
```
struct SampleView: View {
    @State var string: String = "Hello World"

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                TextField("Text", text: $string)
                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)

                Button("Log Error") {
                    LOG("You just broke everything", level: .error)
                }
                Button("Log Warning") {
                    LOG("You should not have done that", level: .warn)
                }
                Button("Log Info") {
                    LOG("Chilling", level: .info)
                }
                Button("Log Success") {
                    LOG("That worked!", level: .success)
                }
                Button("Log Working") {
                    LOG("Working on something...", level: .working)
                }
                Button("Log Debug") {
                    LOG("Print Debugging is where it is at", level: .debug)
                }
            }
        }
        .debuggable(self, id: "Main View")
    }
}
```

#### Adding custom views to the reporter's menus
If you have custom needs for what you want to appear in the reporter (A custom debug menu) you can easily make Hydrogen take care of this view by adding it by registering it using the `.customDebuggableView()` modifier!. Just provide the view and then an ID to identify the view.

```
struct SampleView: View {
    @State var string: String = "Hello World"

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                TextField("Text", text: $string)
                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        }
        .customDebuggableView(customView, id: "Custom View")
    }
    
    var customView: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("A Custom View!")
            Text("Some State \(string)")
        }
    }
}
```
